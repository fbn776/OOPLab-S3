### Questions

##### (A) Basic programs using datatypes, operators, and control statements in Java.

1) Write a Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
2) Write a Java Program to find the frequency of a given character in a string. **
3) Write a Java program to multiply two given matrices.

##### (B) Object Oriented Programming Concepts: Problem on the use of constructors, inheritance, method overloading & overriding, polymorphism and garbage collection:

4) Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following members: Name, Age, Phone number,
	 Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'print-
	 Salary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager'
	 inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'spe-
	 cialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address
	 and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and
	 print the same. (Exercise to understand inheritance). **
5) Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty
	 method named numberOfSides( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and
	 Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the class-
	 es contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the giv-
	 en geometrical structures. (Exercise to understand polymorphism).
6) Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of garbage collector.
